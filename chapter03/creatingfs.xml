<title>Creating a file system on the new partition</title>

<para>
Once the partition is created, we have to create a new file system on
that partition. To create an ext2 file system, use the mke2fs command. 
To create a reiser file system, the mkreiserfs command should be used. 
The new partition is used as the only option to the command and the file 
system is created. If the partition is hda11 and ext2 is to be created, 
run the following:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>mke2fs /dev/xxx</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
To create a reiser file system, run the following:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>mkreiserfs /dev/xxx</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Replace "xxx" by the partition's designation (like hda11).
