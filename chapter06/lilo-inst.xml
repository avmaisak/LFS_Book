<title>Installation of Lilo</title>

<para>
We have chosen Lilo because we feel confortable with it, but you may wish to
take a look elsewhere. Someone has written a <ulink

GRUB</ulink>, an alternative boot loader.
</para>

<para>
Install Lilo by running the following commands:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>
	<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>make install</userinput>
</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
It appears that compilation of this package fails on certain machines
when the -g compiler flag is being used. If you can't compile Lilo at
all, you should try to remove the -g value from the CFLAGS variable in the
<filename>Makefile</filename> file.
</para>

<para>
At the end of the installation the make install process will print a
message stating that /sbin/lilo has to be executed to complete the
update. Don't do this as it has no use. The /etc/lilo.conf isn't present
yet. We will complete the installation of lilo in chapter 8.

<para>
Maybe you'll be interested to know that someone wrote a hint on how to get a
logo instead the the standard LILO prompt or menu. Take a look at it <ulink
