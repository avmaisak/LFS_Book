<sect2><title>Configuring Shadow Password Suite</title>

<para>
This package contains the utilities to modify user's passwords, add new
users/groups, delete users/groups and more. We're not going to explain 
what 'password shadowing' means. All about that can be read in the doc/HOWTO
file within the unpacked shadow password suite's source tree. There's one 
thing you should keep in mind, if you decide to use shadow support, that 
programs that need to verify passwords (examples are xdm, ftp daemons, 
pop3 daemons, etc) need to be 'shadow-compliant', eg. they need to
be able to work with shadow'ed passwords.

<para>
Shadow'ed passwords are not enabled by default. Simply installing the
shadow password suite does not enable shadow'ed passwords.
</para>

<para>
Now is a very good moment to read chapter 5 of the doc/HOWTO file. It 
describes how to enable shadow'ed passwords, how to test whether 
shadowing works and if not, how to disable it again.
</para>

<para>
The documentation mentions something about the creation of npasswd and
nshadow after pwconv is run. This is an error in the documentation.
Those two files will not be created. After pwconv is run, /etc/passwd
will no longer contain the passwords and /etc/shadow will. You don't
need to rename the npasswd and nshadow files yourself.
