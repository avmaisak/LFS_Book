Both the vim-rt and vim-src packages need to be unpacked to install Vim.
Both packages will unpack their files into the vim-5.7 directory. This
won't overwrite any files from the other package. So it doesn't matter

	<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>make install &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>cd /usr/bin &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>ln -s vim vi</userinput>

If you plan on installing the X Window system on his LFS
system, you might want to re-compile Vim after he has installed X. Vim
comes with a nice GUI version of the editor which requires X and a few
other libraries to be installed. For more information read the Vim
documentation.
