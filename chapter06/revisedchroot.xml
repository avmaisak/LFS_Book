<para>From now on when you exit the chroot environment and wish to re-enter
it, you should run the following modified chroot command.</para>

<para>Additionally, now that all software has been installed there is no
need to use anything from the <filename
class="directory">/tools</filename> directory anymore, so it may be deleted.
However, since the TCL, Expect, and DejaGNU packages only exist here, you
may want to reinstall them after removing the /tools directory.</para>
