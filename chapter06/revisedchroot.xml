<para>From now on, when you exit the chroot environment and wish to reenter
it, you should use the following modified chroot command:</para>

<screen><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin \
    /bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

<para>The reason for this is that, since the programs in <filename 
class="directory">/tools</filename> are no longer needed, you may want to
delete the whole directory and regain the space. Before actually deleting the
directory, exit from chroot and reenter it with the above command. Also, before
removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>, you may want to tar it
up and store it in a safe place, in case you want to build another LFS system
soon.</para>

<note><para>Removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> will also
remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect and DejaGNU, which were used for
running the toolchain tests. If you want to use these programs later on, you
will need to recompile and re-install them. The installation instructions are
the same as in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/>, apart from changing
the prefix from <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> to <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>. The
BLFS book discusses a slightly different approach to installing Tcl, see 
<ulink url="&blfs-root;"/>.</para></note>

<para>You may also want to move the packages and patches stored in <filename 
class="directory">/sources</filename> to a more usual location, such as
<filename class="directory">/usr/src/packages</filename>, and remove the
directory -- or simply delete the whole directory if you've burned its contents
on a CD).</para>
