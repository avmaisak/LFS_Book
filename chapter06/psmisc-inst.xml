<title>Installation of Psmisc</title>

<para>Prepare Psmisc to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The <emphasis>--exec-prefix=/</emphasis> flag will cause the
programs to be installed in /bin rather than in /usr/bin. The programs
in this package are often used in bootscripts; they should be in the /bin
directory so they can be used in the event that the <filename
class="directory">/usr</filename> partition isn't mounted.</para>

<para>Continue with compiling the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Finish installing the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Psmisc's pidof program isn't installed by default. Generally, this
isn't a problem because we later install the Sysvinit package, which
provides a better pidof program.</para>

<para>It's up to you to decide if you are going to use the Sysvinit 
package, which provides a pidof program, or not. If you're not going to
use Sysvinit, you should complete this package's installation by creating
the <filename>/bin/pidof</filename> symlink:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s killall /bin/pidof</userinput></screen></para>
