<para>Let's now create some structure in our LFS file system. Let's create
a directory tree. Issuing the following commands will create a more or less
standard tree:</para>
 
<screen><userinput>install -d /{bin,boot,dev,etc/opt,home,lib,mnt}
install -d /{sbin,srv,usr/local,var,opt}
install -d /root -m 0750
install -d /tmp /var/tmp -m 1777
install -d /media/{floppy,cdrom}
install -d /usr/{bin,include,lib,sbin,share,src}
ln -s share/{man,doc,info} /usr
install -d /usr/share/{doc,info,locale,man}
install -d /usr/share/{misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
install -d /usr/share/man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
install -d /usr/local/{bin,etc,include,lib,sbin,share,src}
ln -s share/{man,doc,info} /usr/local
install -d /usr/local/share/{doc,info,locale,man}
install -d /usr/local/share/{misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
install -d /usr/local/share/man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
install -d /var/{lock,log,mail,run,spool}
install -d /var/{opt,cache,lib/{misc,locate},local}
install -d /opt/{bin,doc,include,info}
install -d /opt/{lib,man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}}</userinput></screen>

<para>Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, but this
isn't desirable for all directories. In the commands above, we make two changes:
one to the home directory of <emphasis>root</emphasis>, and another to the
directories for temporary files.</para>

<para>The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter the
<filename class="directory">/root</filename> directory -- the same
as a normal user would do with his or her home directory.
The second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
<filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> and
<filename class="directory">/var/tmp</filename> directories, but
cannot remove other users' files from them. The latter is prohibited
by the so-called <quote>sticky bit</quote> -- the highest bit in the 1777 bit
mask.</para>

<sect2>
<title>FHS compliance note</title>

<para>We have based our directory tree on the FHS standard (available at
<ulink url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"/>). Besides the above created
tree this standard stipulates the existence of
<filename class="directory">/usr/local/games</filename> and
<filename class="directory">/usr/share/games</filename>, but we don't
much like these for a base system. However, feel free to make your system
FHS-compliant. As to the structure of the
<filename class="directory">/usr/local/share</filename> subdirectory, the FHS
isn't precise, so we created here the directories that we think are needed.</para>
