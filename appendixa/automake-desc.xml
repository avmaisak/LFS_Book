<sect4><title>aclocal, aclocal-1.6</title>
<para>automake includes a number of autoconf macros which can be used in
packages, some of which are needed by automake in certain
situations. These macros must be defined in the aclocal.m4-file
or they will not be seen by autoconf.</para>

<para>The aclocal program will automatically generate aclocal.m4 files
based on the contents of configure.in. This provides a convenient
way to get automake-provided macros without having to search around.
Also, the aclocal mechanism is extensible for use 
by other packages.</para></sect4>
