<para><command>flex</command> is a tool for generating programs that
recognize patterns in text. Pattern recognition is useful in many applications.
From a set of rules on what to look for flex makes a program that looks for
those patterns. The reason to use flex is that it is much easier to specify
the rules for than to write the actual pattern-finding program.</para>

<para><command>flex++</command> invokes a version of flex that is used
exclusively for C++ scanners.</para>
