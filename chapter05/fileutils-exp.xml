<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tmp &gt; lib/Makefile.in : </userinput></screen> This 
is used to fix a problem with building fileutils statically on glibc 2.2.3 
systems.  If this isn't done, then there is the possibility of all of the 
fileutils programs causing segmentation faults once chroot is entered 
in chapter 6.</para>

<para><userinput>--libexecdir=$LFS/bin:</userinput> This configure option will
set the program executable directory to $LFS/bin. This is normally set
to /usr/libexec, but nothing is placed in it. Changing it just prevents
that directory from being created.</para>
