<title>Installation of Expect</title>

<para>First apply a patch:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&expect-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>This fixes a bug in Expect that can result in bogus failures during the
GCC test suite run.</para>

<para>Now prepare Expect for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/tools --with-tcl=/tools/lib --with-x=no</userinput></screen>

<para>The meaning of the configure options:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><userinput>--with-tcl=/tools/lib</userinput>: This ensures that
the configure script finds the Tcl installation in our temporary tools location.
We don't want it to find an existing one that may possibly reside on the host
system.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><userinput>--with-x=no</userinput>: This tells the configure
script not to search for Tk (the Tcl GUI component) or the X Window System
libraries, both of which may possibly reside on the host system.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Build the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>(If you insist on testing the results, then issue:
<userinput>make test</userinput>. However, the Expect test suite is known to
experience failures under certain host conditions that are not fully
understood. Therefore, test suite failures here are not surprising, and are not
considered critical.)</para>

<para>And install it:</para>

<screen><userinput>make SCRIPTS="" install</userinput></screen>

<para>The meaning of the make parameter:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><userinput>SCRIPTS=""</userinput>: This prevents installation of
the supplementary expect scripts which are not needed.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>You can now remove the source directories of both Tcl and Expect.</para>
