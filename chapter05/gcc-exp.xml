<userinput>--enable-languages=c,c++:</userinput> This only builds the C
and C++ compilers and not the other available compilers as they are, on
the average, not often used. If you do need those other compilers don't
use the --enable-languages parameter.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>ln -s ../usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/2.95.2.1/cpp:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/lib/cpp symlink. Some packages explicitely try to find
cpp in /lib.

<userinput>ln -s ../usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/2.95.2.1/cpp:</userinput> This
