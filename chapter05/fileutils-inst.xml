<title>Installation of Fileutils</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it. Make sure it's unpacked before running the installation 
commands.</para>

<para>The programs from a statically linked Fileutils package may cause
segmentation faults on certain systems, if your distribution has
Glibc-2.2.3 or higher installed. It seems to happen mostly on machines
powered by an AMD CPU, but there is a case or two where an Intel system
is affected as well. If your system falls in this category, apply the
patch.</para>

<para>Note that in some cases using this patch will result in not being
able to compile this package at all, even when your system has an AMD CPU
and has Glibc-2.2.3 (or higher) installed. If that's the case, you'll need
to remove the fileutils-&fileutils-version; directory and unpack it again
from the tarball before continuing. We believe this may be the case when
your distribution has altered Glibc-2.2.3 somehow, but details are
unavailable at the time.</para>

<para>To fix this package to compile properly on AMD/Glibc-2.2.3
machines, run the following command. Do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
attempt this fix if you don't have Glibc-2.2.3 installed. It will more 
than likely result in all kinds of compile time problems.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../fileutils-&fileutils-version;.patch</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install Fileutils by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --disable-nls --prefix=$LFS/static &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Once you have installed Fileutils, you can test whether the
segmentation fault problem has been avoided by running
<userinput>$LFS/static/bin/ls</userinput>. If this works, then you are OK. If
not, then you need to re-do the installation using the sed commands if 
you didn't use them, or without the sed commands if you did use 
them.</para>
