These are the TODO items for the next LFS release (3.0):

* Consider ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/
  to replace console-tools/console-data

* Try new procps install:
	make OPT="$CFLAGS" INCDIRS='-I/usr/include -I.' XSCPT='' install	
* When installing Glibc in chapter 6 glibc-build/login/pt_chown isn't
  installed (we'll copy manually for now) and the mtrace program isn't
  build. Find out why.

* Incorporate LFS FAQ in the book

* Full dependency list. This list isn't a list of "package a depends on
  package b", but a list of "package a depends on b and c from
  package d"

* Bring the book up to speed with the current FHS specs.

* Mention security patches that can be applied to packages.

* Explain how changing runlevels works. Use the file written by Simon
  Perreault at http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/runlevels.txt

* Don't run lilo from inside chroot anymore. This causes severe problems
  sometimes including LILO not bootstrapping properly.

* Bring back the PPC book (recreate from scratch using current intel
  book) using Jesse McCrosky's notes at
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/ppc-notes.txt
  and the patch to the 'patch' package at:
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/ppc-patch.patch

* Add descriptions what the patches do we use (like the console-tools and gzip
  patches)

* Try out Slackware's MAKEDEV script and see if it's any better than the
  currently used one. A copy can be found at
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/Slackware-MAKEDEV

* Sed'ing the MAKEDEV script gives us hda[1-20], hdb[1-20] and so forth.
  Mention that all of these can't actually be used due to kernel
  limitations (IDE goes to 16 max for example).

* Mention LFS should be installed as user root

* Add netkit-base and net-tools to Appendix A.

* Suggest using this command to strip debug symbols after you finish
  chapter 6: find $LFS -type f -exec strip --strip-debug '{}' ';'
