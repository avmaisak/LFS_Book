<title>Entering the chroot'ed environment</title>

<para>
It's time to enter our chroot'ed environment in order to install the
rest of the software we need.
</para>

<para>
Enter the following command to enter the chroot'ed environment. From
this point on there's no need to use the $LFS variable anymore, because
everything you do will be restricted to the LFS partition (since / is
actually /mnt/lfs but the shell doesn't know that).
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cd $LFS &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>chroot $LFS /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root /bin/bash 
		--login</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Now that we are inside a chroot'ed environment, we can continue to
install all the basic system software. Make sure you execute all the
following commands in this chapter from within the chroot'ed
environment.
</para>

<para>
Note that the bash prompt will contain "I have no name!". This is
normal; Glibc hasn't been installed yet.
