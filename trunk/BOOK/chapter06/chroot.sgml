<title>Entering the chroot'ed environment</title>

<para>
It's time to enter our chroot'ed environment in order to install the
rest of the software we need.
</para>

<para>
Enter the following command to enter the chroot'ed environment. From
this point on there's no need to use the $LFS variable anymore, because
everything you do will be restricted to the LFS partition (since / is
actually /mnt/lfs but the shell doesn't know that).
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cd $LFS &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>chroot $LFS /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root /bin/bash 
		--login</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Now that we are inside a chroot'ed environment, we can continue to
install all the basic system software. Make sure you execute all the
following commands in this and following chapters from within the 
chroot'ed environment. If you ever leave this environment for a reason
(say when you reboot or something) don't forget to mount $LFS/proc again 
like you did earlier and to re-enter chroot before you continue with the
book.
</para>

<para>
Note that the bash prompt will contain "I have no name!". This is
normal; Glibc hasn't been installed yet.
