<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it. Make sure it's unpacked before running the installation 
commands.</para>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options). GCC is
best left alone.  Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables
that override default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we
recommend unsetting or modifying them when building binutils.  You have
been warned.</para>

<para>Install GCC by running the following commands. These commands will build
the C and C++ compiler. Other compilers are available within the gcc
package. If you want to build all the other available compilers too,
leave out the --enable-languages=c,c++ option in the configure command.
See the GCC documentation for more details on which additional compilers
are available.</para>

<para>Note: the build of other compilers is not tested by the people 
who actively work on LFS.</para>
