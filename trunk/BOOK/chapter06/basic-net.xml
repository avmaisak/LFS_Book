<title>Setting up Basic Networking</title>
<?dbhtml filename="basic-net.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>Here will be set up basic networking now that all the necessary
software has been installed. There isn't all that much to do, really,
just creating a basic <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file, and downloading
some high-quality network information files.</para>

<para>The first step is to create <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>. This file
contains information allowing resolution of host names to IP addresses.
Create a very basic one (we'll make a better one later, but Perl needs it now
for doing some tests) with the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>echo "127.0.0.1 $(hostname) localhost" > /etc/hosts</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now unpack the Lfs-Utils tarball again, as we're going to copy two
necessary files from it. One is <filename>/etc/services</filename>, which is
used to resolve service numbers to human-readable names, and the other is
<filename>/etc/protocols</filename>, which does the same for protocol numbers.
Copy them with the following command after you have entered the Lfs-Utils
directory:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -f etc/{services,protocols} /etc</userinput></screen></para>
