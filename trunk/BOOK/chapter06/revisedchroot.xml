<title>Cleaning Up</title>

<para>From now on, when reentering the chroot environment after
exiting, use the following modified chroot command:</para>

<screen><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin \
    /bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

<para>The reason for this is that the programs in <filename
class="directory">/tools</filename> are no longer needed.  Since they are no
longer needed you can delete the <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>
directory if so desired or tar it up and keep it to build another final
system.</para>

<note><para>Removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> will also
remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect, and DejaGNU which were used for
running the toolchain tests. If you need these programs later on, they will need
to be recompiled and re-installed. The BLFS book has instructions for this (see
<ulink url="&blfs-root;"/>).</para></note>
