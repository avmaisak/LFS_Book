<para><userinput>sed 's/-ltermcap/-lncurses/' Makefile | make -f -:</userinput> 
This will replace -ltermcap with -lncurses in the Makefile and pipe the
output of sed (the modified Makefile) directly to the make program. This
is an alternate and more efficient way to direct the output to a file
and tell make to use that alternate file. We do this because libtermcap
is declared obsolete in favor of libncurses.</para>
