<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options).
Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables that override
default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we recommend un-setting
or modifying them when building GCC.</para>

<para>This is an older release of GCC which we are going to install for the
purpose of compiling the Linux kernel in <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>.
This version is recommended by the kernel developers when you need absolute
stability. Later versions of GCC have not received as much testing for Linux
kernel compilation. Using a later version is likely to work, however, we
recommend adhering to the kernel developer's advice and using the version here
to compile your kernel.</para>

<note><para>We don't install the C++ compiler or libraries here. However, there
may be reasons why you would want to install them. More information can be found
at <ulink url="&blfs-root;view/stable/general/gcc2.html"/>.</para></note>

<para>We'll install this older release of GCC into the non-standard prefix of
<filename class="directory">/opt</filename> so as to avoid interfering with
the system GCC already installed in <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
 .</para>

<para>Apply the patches and make a small adjustment:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-&gcc-2953-version;-2.patch
patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-&gcc-2953-version;-no-fixinc.patch
patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-&gcc-2953-version;-returntype-fix.patch
echo timestamp &gt; gcc/cstamp-h.in</userinput></screen>

<para>The GCC documentation recommends building GCC outside of the source
directory in a dedicated build directory:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir ../gcc-2-build
cd ../gcc-2-build</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile and install the compiler:</para>

<screen><userinput>../gcc-&gcc-2953-version;/configure --prefix=/opt/gcc-&gcc-2953-version; \
    --enable-shared --enable-languages=c \
    --enable-threads=posix
make bootstrap
make install</userinput></screen>
