<para><userinput>PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin ./configure -default</userinput>:
The paths to some programs get written into man's files. Unfortunately, the
configure script picks the last location in PATH rather than the first
where a program is found. By appending /usr/bin:/bin to PATH for the
./configure command, we make sure that man doesn't use the /static versions
of our programs.</para>

<para><userinput>sed -e '/^NROFF/s/-mandoc/-c -mandoc/'</userinput>:
This prevents groff from using SGR (Set Graphics Rendition) escape
sequences on our man pages.</para>
