<title>Installation of Sysvinit</title>

<para>
When run levels are changed (for example when going to shutdown
the system) the init program is going to send the TERM and KILL signals
to all the processes that init started. But init prints a message to the 
screen saying "sending all processes the TERM signal" and the same for the 
KILL signal. This implies that init sends this signal to all the currently 
running processes, which isn't the case. To avoid this confusion a user can 
apply the sysvinit patch found on the LFS FTP site to sysvinit that changes 
the sentence in the shutdown.c file and have it print "sending all 
processes started by init the TERM signal".
