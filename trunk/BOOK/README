How do I convert these XML files to other formats like HTML, PF, PS
and TXT? You need to have some software installed that deal with these
conversions. Please read the INSTALL file how to install that software.
Then come back to this file for examples how to convert these files
into various other formats.

XML to HTML:
------------
Create a directory in which you want to store the HTML files and cd into 
that directory. Now run:
	/usr/bin/openjade -t sgml \
		-d /usr/share/dsssl/docbook/html/lfs.dsl \
		/usr/share/dsssl/docbook/dtds/decls/xml.dcl \
		/path/to/intel.xml

While openjade is running you will see a lot of the following kind of
errors:

/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:6:19:E: "X00E1"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:7:19:E: "X00C1"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:8:18:E: "X00E2"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:9:18:E: "X00C2"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:10:19:E: "X00E0"
is not a function name

They are normal in the sense of that it doens't affect the output
files. A fix hasn't been found yet so we'll just have to live with it.


XML to NOCHUNKS-HTML:
--------------------
The NOCHUNKS HTML version is one big HTML file:
	/usr/bin/openjade -t sgml \
		-V nochunks \
		-d /usr/share/dsssl/docbook/html/lfs.dsl \
		/usr/share/dsssl/docbook/dtds/decls/xml.dcl \
		/path/to/intel.xml > nochunks.html

XML to TXT:
-----------
First create the NOCHUNKS HTML file, then convert by running:
	/usr/bin/lynx -dump nochunks.html > output.txt

XML to PS and PDF:
-----------
First create the NOCHUNKS HTML file, then convert by starting
htmldoc. You can use the GUI and select the options. If you're
satisfied by the default options you can run this command:

	/usr/bin/htmldoc --book --firstpage p1 -v -t <type> \
		-f <output> nochunks.html

replace <type> by pdf13 to create pdf file or replace <type> by ps3 to
create ps file. There are other pdf and ps levels, see the man page for
possible other options. Replace <output> with the filename of the ps or
pdf file that is to be generated.
