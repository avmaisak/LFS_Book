<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it.</para>

<para>We won't be needing a C++ compiler until Chapter 6. So, only
the gcc-core tarball needs to be unpacked at this time.</para>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options). GCC is
best left alone. Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables
that override default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we
recommend unsetting or modifying them when building GCC. You have
been warned.</para>

<para>Install GCC by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir ../gcc-build &amp;&amp;
cd ../gcc-build &amp;&amp;
../gcc-&gcc-version;/configure --prefix=/static \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--disable-nls --disable-shared \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-as=$LFS/static/bin/as \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-ld=$LFS/static/bin/ld &amp;&amp;
make BOOT_LDFLAGS="-static" bootstrap &amp;&amp;
make prefix=$LFS/static install-no-fixedincludes &amp;&amp;
ln -s gcc $LFS/static/bin/cc</userinput></screen></para>
