<title>How to unsubscribe?</title>

<para>
To unsubscribe from a list, send an email to
<ulink url="mailto:listar@linuxfromscratch.org">
listar@linuxfromscratch.org</ulink> and write <emphasis>unsubscribe
listname</emphasis> as the subject header of the message.
</para>

<para>
You can, if you want, unsubscribe from multiple lists at the same time
using one email. If you want to do so, write some junk as the
subject header, something that isn't a valid command like "hello". Then 
write the unsubscribe commands in the body of the message. The email 
will look like: 
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

To: listar@linuxfromscratch.org
Subject: hello 

unsubscribe lfs-discuss
unsubscribe lfs-apps
unsubscribe alfs-discuss 

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
After you have sent the email, the Listar program will send you an 
email back requesting a confirmation of your unsubscription
request. After you have sent back this confirmation email, Listar will 
send you an email again with the message that you have been unsubscribed 
from the list(s).
