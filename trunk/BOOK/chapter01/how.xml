<para>You are going to build your LFS system by using a previously installed 
Linux distribution such as Debian, Mandrake, Red Hat, etc. The existing Linux 
system (host) will be used as a starting point, because you will need programs 
like a compiler, linker, text editor, and other development tools to build the 
new system. Ordinarily, the required tools are available by default if you 
selected <quote>development</quote> as one of your installation options when 
you installed your Linux distribution.</para>

<para>After you have downloaded the packages that make up a LFS system, you 
will create a new Linux native partition and filesystem. This new Linux 
partition and filesystem is where your new LFS system will be compiled and 
installed onto.</para>

<para>Chapter 5 will then discuss the installation of a number of packages that 
will form the basic development suite (or tool-set) which is used to build the 
actual system in Chapter 6. Some of these packages are needed to resolve 
circular dependencies. For example, to compile a compiler you need a 
compiler.</para>

<para>The first thing to be done in Chapter 5 is build a first pass of the 
toolchain, which is made up of Binutils and GCC. The programs from these 
packages will be linked statically in order for them to be used independently 
of the host system. The second thing to do is build Glibc, the C library. Glibc 
will be compiled by the toolchain programs we just built in the first 
pass.</para>

<para>The third thing to do is build a second pass of the toolchain. This time 
the toolchain will be dynamically linked against the newly built Glibc. The 
remaining Chapter 5 packages are all built using this second pass toolchain and 
dynamically linked against the new host-independent Glibc. When this is done, 
the LFS installation process will no longer depend on the host distribution, 
with the exception of the running kernel. This is known as <quote>self 
contained</quote> and <quote>self hosted</quote>. There is a discussion of the 
differences between statically and dynamically linked programs at the beginning 
of Chapter 5.</para>

<para>You may be asking yourself <quote>that seems like a lot of work, just to 
get away from my host distribution</quote>. Let us take a few minutes to 
discuss this question. The work involved in building the packages in Chapter 5 
is to ensure that as little information from your host makes it into your new 
pristine LFS system. When you build the first two packages in Chapter 5, 
Binutils and GCC, they will be compiled statically.  This means that the 
version of the C library on your host distribution will be embedded inside all 
the binary programs you just compiled. This will cause problems for you down 
the road (they have been well documented). The host's Glibc is usually an 
unknown quantity and can contain bugs or anything else we don't know about 
until it is too late. A well known issue is that statically linked binaries 
compiled on a Glibc-2.2.x based system that then contain calls to the 
<emphasis>getpwuid()</emphasis> function crash when run on a Glibc-2.3.x based
system.  You are 
about to build a Glibc-2.3.x based system.  You do not want to build something 
that is going to crash do you?  Finally, the Glibc autoconf tests produce 
different results depending on whether an existing Glibc is found on the host 
distribution. This can lead to inconsistencies and encourages hacks and 
workarounds. With all these things in mind, you can see that the extra effort 
to compile Binutils and GCC twice is well worth it.</para>

<para>In Chapter 6 your real LFS system will be built. The chroot (change root) 
program is used to enter a virtual environment and start a new shell whose root 
directory will be set to the LFS partition. This is very similar to rebooting 
and instructing the kernel to mount the LFS partition as the root partition. 
The reason that you don't actually reboot, but instead chroot, is that creating 
a bootable system requires additional work which isn't necessary. As well, 
chrooting allows you to continue using the host while LFS is being built.  
While software is being installed you can simply switch to a different VC 
(Virtual Console) or X desktop and continue using the computer as you normally 
would.</para>

<para>When all the software from Chapter 6 is installed, the temporary tools 
built in Chapter 5 will be removed. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 will finalize the 
installation. The bootscripts are setup in Chapter 7, the kernel and boot 
loader are setup in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 has some pointers to help you after 
you finish with the book.  Then, finally, you reboot your computer into your 
new LFS system.</para>

<para>This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on the steps you 
will take are discussed in the chapters and package descriptions as you 
progress through them. If something isn't completely clear now, don't worry, 
everything will fall into place soon.</para>

<para>Please read Chapter 2 carefully as it explains a few important things you 
should be aware of before you begin to work through Chapters 5 and 
beyond.</para>
