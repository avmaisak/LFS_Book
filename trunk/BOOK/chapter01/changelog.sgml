Chapter 4: Tell the user to use cfdisk rather than fdisk. The fdisk man
page recommends cfdisk over fdisk because it's more stable.

Chapter 5: Added static mawk, texinfo and partially gettext to faciliate
the move of Glibc from Chapter 5 to Chapter 6.

Chapter 5: Added Makedev to chapter 5. We don't create the device files
here, only copy the MAKEDEV script and make a temp copy which will be
used to create device files. This second file (MAKEDEV-temp) doesn't
contain user names and group names but only user id's and group id's. We
need a few device files to get Glibc installed, but before GLibc is
installed user and group names are not recognized yet; only the numeric
id's. This requires a slightly modified MAKEDEV script which will be
generated by patching the original one. This patching is done here in
chapter 5.

Chapter 6: No need to cd into glibc-build before running configure and

configparms file
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Only copy the man pages from the ld.so package. We don't need
the ldconfig and ldd programs anymore; Glibc-2.2.1 comes with good
working versions.

installation.
