<title>How to subscribe?</title>

<para>
You can subscribe to any of the above mentioned mailinglists by sending
an email to <ulink url="mailto:listar@linuxfromscratch.org">
listar@linuxfromscratch.org</ulink> and write <emphasis>subscribe
listname</emphasis> in the subject line of the message.
</para>

<para>
You can, if you want, subscribe to multiple lists at the same time using
one email. If you want to do so, write some junk in the subject
line, something that isn't a valid command like "hello". Then write 
the subscribe commands in the body of the message. The email will look 
like:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

To: listar@linuxfromscratch.org
Subject: hello

subscribe lfs-discuss
subscribe lfs-apps
subscribe alfs-discuss

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
After you have sent the email, the Listar program will send you an
email back requesting a confirmation of your subscription request. After
you have sent back this confirmation email, Majordomo will send you an
email again with the message that you have been subscribed to the
list(s) along with an introduction message for that particulair list.
