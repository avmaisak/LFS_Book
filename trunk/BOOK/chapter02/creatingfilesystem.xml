<title>Creating a File System on the Partition</title>
<?dbhtml filename="creatingfilesystem.html"?>

<para>Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can
be created. The most widely-used system in the Linux world is the
second extended file system (ext2), but with the newer high-capacity
hard disks, the journaling file systems are becoming increasingly
popular.  Here we will create an ext2 file system, but build
instructions for other file systems can be found at <ulink
url="&blfs-root;view/svn/postlfs/filesystems.html"/>.</para>

<para>To create an ext2 file system on the LFS partition, run the following:</para>

<screen><userinput>mke2fs /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<para>Replace <replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> with the name of the LFS
partition (<filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename> in our previous example).</para>

<para>If a swap partition was created, it will need to be initialized
as a swap partition too (also known as formatting, as described above
with <command>mke2fs</command>) by running the following. If you are using an existing
swap partition, there is no need to format it.</para>

<screen><userinput>mkswap /dev/<replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<para>Replace <replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable> with the name of the swap
partition.</para>
