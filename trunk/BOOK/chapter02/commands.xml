<title>Download the LFS Commands</title>

<para>
LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book. These files can be
used to dump to a shell and install the packages, though some files 
need to be modified (for example, when the kbd package is 
installed, it is needed to select the keyboard layout file, which can't be
guessed).
</para>

<para>
These files can be used to quickly find out which commands have been
changed between the different LFS versions as well. A user just downloads the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book version 
and runs a diff on the files. That way it is possible to see which packages
have 
updated installation instructions, and he can modify his own scripts or 
reinstall a package if it seems necessary.
