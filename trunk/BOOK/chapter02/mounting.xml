<title>Mounting the New Partition</title>
<?dbhtml filename="mounting.html"?>

<para>Now that a file system has been created, the partition needs to
be made accessible. In order to do this, the partition needs to be
mounted at a chosen mount point. For the purposes of this book, it is
assumed that the file system is mounted under <filename
class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename>, but the directory choice is up
to you.</para>

<para>Choose a mount point and assign it to the <envar>LFS</envar> 
environment variable by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</userinput></screen>

<para>Next, create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by
running:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS
mount /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>Replace <replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> with the designation of the LFS
partition.</para>

<para>If using multiple partitions for LFS (e.g., one for <filename
class="directory">/</filename> and another for <filename
class="directory">/usr</filename>), mount them using:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS
mount /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> $LFS
mkdir $LFS/usr
mount /dev/<replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable> $LFS/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>Replace <replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> and
<replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable> with the appropriate partition
names.</para>

<para>Ensure that this new partition is not mounted with permissions
that are too restrictive (such as the nosuid, nodev, or noatime
options). Run the <command>mount</command> command without any
parameters to see what options are set for the mounted LFS
partition. If <parameter>nosuid</parameter>, <parameter>nodev</parameter>,
and/or <parameter>noatime</parameter> are set, the partition will need
to be remounted.</para>

<para>Now that there is an established place to work, it is time to
download the packages.</para>
