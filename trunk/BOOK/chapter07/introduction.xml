This chapter will create the necessary scripts that are run at boot time.
These scripts perform tasks such as remounting the root file system
mounted read-only by the kernel into read-write mode, activating the swap
partition(s), running a check on the root file system to make sure it's
intact, setting up networking and starting the daemons that the system uses.

We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style because it
is widely used and we feel confortable with it. If you want to try something
else, someone has written an LFS-Hint on <ulink

scripts</ulink>.
