<para>This chapter details how to install the bootscripts and set them up
properly. Most of these scripts will work without modification, but a
few require additional configuration files because they deal with
hardware-dependent information.</para>

<para>System-V style init scripts are employed in this book because they are
widely used. For additional options, a hint detailing the BSD style
init setup is available at
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/bsd-init.txt"/>.
Searching the LFS mailing lists for <quote>depinit</quote> will also offer
additional choices.</para>

<para>If using an alternate style of init scripts, skip this chapter
and move on to <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>.</para>
