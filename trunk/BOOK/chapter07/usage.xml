<title>How Do These Bootscripts Work?</title>

<para>Linux uses a special booting facility named SysVinit that is
based on a concept of <emphasis>run-levels</emphasis>. It can be quite
different from one system to another, so it cannot be assumed that
because things worked in &lt;insert distro name&gt;, they should work
the same in LFS too. LFS has its own way of doing things, but it
respects generally accepted standards.</para>

<para>SysVinit (which will be referred to as <quote>init</quote> from
now on) works using a run-levels scheme. There are seven (from 0 to 6)
run-levels (actually, there are more run-levels, but they are for
special cases and are generally not used. The init man page describes
those details), and each one of those corresponds to the actions the
computer is supposed to perform when it starts up. The default
run-level is 3. Here are the descriptions of the different run-levels
as they are implemented:</para>

<literallayout>0: halt the computer
1: single-user mode
2: multi-user mode without networking
3: multi-user mode with networking
4: reserved for customization, otherwise does the same as 3
5: same as 4, it is usually used for GUI login (like X's <command>xdm</command> or KDE's <command>kdm</command>)
6: reboot the computer</literallayout>

<para>The command used to change run-levels is <command>init
<replaceable>[runlevel]</replaceable></command>, where
<replaceable>[runlevel]</replaceable> is the target run-level. For
example, to reboot the computer, a user would issue the <command>init
6</command> command.  The <command>reboot</command> command is an
alias for it, as is the <command>halt</command> command an alias for
<command>init 0</command>.</para>

<para>There are a number of directories under <filename
class="directory">/etc/rc.d</filename> that look like <filename
class="directory">rc?.d</filename> (where ? is the number of the
run-level) and <filename class="directory">rcsysinit.d</filename>, all
containing a number of symbolic links. Some begin with a
<emphasis>K</emphasis>, the others begin with an
<emphasis>S</emphasis>, and all of them have two numbers following the
initial letter. The K means to stop (kill) a service and the S means
to start a service. The numbers determine the order in which the
scripts are run, from 00 to 99&mdash;the lower the number the earlier it
gets executed. When init switches to another run-level, the
appropriate services get killed and others get started.</para>

<para>The real scripts are in <filename
class="directory">/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>. They do the actual
work, and the symlinks all point to them. Killing links and starting
links point to the same script in <filename
class="directory">/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>. This is because the
scripts can be called with different parameters like
<parameter>start</parameter>, <parameter>stop</parameter>,
<parameter>restart</parameter>, <parameter>reload</parameter>, and
<parameter>status</parameter>. When a K link is encountered, the
appropriate script is run with the <parameter>stop</parameter>
argument. When an S link is encountered, the appropriate script is run
with the <parameter>start</parameter> argument.</para>

<para>There is one exception to this explanation. Links that start
with an <emphasis>S</emphasis> in the <filename
class="directory">rc0.d</filename> and <filename
class="directory">rc6.d</filename> directories will not cause anything
to be started. They will be called with the parameter
<parameter>stop</parameter> to stop something. The logic behind this
is that when a user is going to reboot or halt the system, nothing
needs to be started.  The system only needs to be stopped.</para>

<para>These are descriptions of what the arguments make the scripts
do:</para>

<varlistentry>
<term><parameter>restart</parameter></term>
<listitem><para>The service is stopped and then started again.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><parameter>reload</parameter></term>
<listitem><para>The configuration of the service is updated.
This is used after the configuration file of a service was modified, when 
the service does not need to be restarted.</para></listitem>

<varlistentry>
<term><parameter>status</parameter></term>
<listitem><para>Tells if the service is running and with which PIDs.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>Feel free to modify the way the boot process works (after all,
it is your own LFS system). The files given here are an example of how
it can be done.</para>
