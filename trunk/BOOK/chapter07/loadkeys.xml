<para>If back in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/> you decided to go
compile your keymap directly into the kernel (later on in <xref
linkend="chapter-mixture"/>), then strictly speaking you don't need to run this
loadkeys script, since the kernel will set up the keymap for you. If you wish,
you can still run the script, it isn't going to hurt you. Keeping it could even
be beneficial, in case you run a lot of different kernels and can't be sure
that the keymap is compiled into every one of them.</para>

<para>If you decided you don't need or don't want to use the loadkeys script,
remove the <filename
class="symlink">/etc/rc.d/rcsysinit.d/S70loadkeys</filename> symlink.</para>
