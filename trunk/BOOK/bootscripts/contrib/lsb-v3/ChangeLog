20100529 - [matthew]
                * Only copy /lib/udev/devices/null, as Udev >= 155 copies
                  devices from /lib/udev/devices to /dev itself.
                  Udevd still needs /dev/null present before starting up though.

                * Added hard deps to network script for local_fs, swap, and
                  localnet (account for /usr at network instead of $remote_fs).

                * Cleaned up script headers to reflect real Start or Stop

20080315 - [dj] * Corrected test for $pidfile in pidofproc()
