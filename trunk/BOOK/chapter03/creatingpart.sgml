<title>Creating a new partition</title>

<para>
Before we can build our new Linux system, we need to have an empty Linux
partition on which we can build our new system. I recommend a partition size
of around 750 MB. This gives you enough space to store all the tarballs and 
to compile all packages without worrying running out of the necessary 
temporary disk space. If you already have a Linux Native partition available, 
you can skip this subsection.

Start the fdisk program (or another fdisk program you prefer) with the
appropriate hard disk as the option (like /dev/hda if you want to create a
new partition on the primary master IDE disk). Create a Linux Native
partition, write the partition table and exit the fdisk program. If you get
the message that you need to reboot your system to ensure that the partition
table is updated, then please reboot your system now before continuing.
Remember what your new partition's designation is. It could be something
like hda11 (as it is in my case). This newly created partition will be
referred to as the LFS partition in this book.
