<para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

<para>It may be a good idea to create an
<filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename> file. By having this file, it is
very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some
point) to find out which LFS version is installed on the system.
Create this file by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>
