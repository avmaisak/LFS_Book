<title>Rebooting the System</title>
<?dbhtml filename="reboot.html"?>

<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot
your computer. However, you should be aware of a few things.  The system you
have created in this book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have
the functionality you would need to be able to continue forward.  By installing
a few extra packages from the BLFS book while still in our current chroot
environment, you can leave yourself in a much better position to continue on
once you reboot into your new LFS installation.  Installing a text mode web
browser, such as Lynx, you can easily view the BLFS book in one virtual
terminal, while building packages in another.  The GPM package will also allow
you to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual terminals.  Lastly, if you
are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet your networking
requirements, installing packages such as dhcpcd or ppp at this point might
also be useful.</para> 


<para>Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny new LFS
installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment:</para>

<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

<para>Then unmount the virtual files systems:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/dev/shm
umount $LFS/dev
umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS/sys</userinput></screen>    

<para>Unmount the LFS file system itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other
partitions before unmounting the main one, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>Now, reboot the system with:</para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>Assuming the Grub boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu
is set to boot <emphasis>LFS &version;</emphasis> automatically.</para>

<para>When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and
software can be added.</para>
