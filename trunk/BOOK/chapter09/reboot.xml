<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot
your computer. First exit from the chroot environment:</para>

<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

<para>Then unmount the virtual files systems:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/proc</userinput></screen>    

<para>And unmount the LFS file system:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If at the start you decided to create multiple partitions, you'll need to
unmount the other partitions before unmounting the main one, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>Now reboot your system with:</para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>Assuming the Grub boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu
is set to boot <emphasis>LFS &milestone;</emphasis> automatically.</para>

<para>When the reboot is complete, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>
