<para>To make things easier to follow, there are a few typographical
conventions used throughout this book. This section contains some
examples of the typographical format found throughout Linux From
Scratch.</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>This form of text is designed to be typed exactly as seen unless
otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used in the
explanation sections to identify which of the commands is being
referenced.</para>

<screen><computeroutput>install-info: unknown option '--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</computeroutput></screen>

<para>This form of text (fixed width text) shows screen output,
probably as the result of commands issued.  This format is also used
to show filenames, such as
<filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.</para>

<para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

<para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the book,
mainly to emphasize important points or items.</para>

<para><ulink url="&lfs-root;"/></para>

<para>This format is used for hyperlinks, both within the LFS
community and to external pages, including HOWTOs, download locations,
and websites.</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal>root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

<para>This format is used when creating configuration files. The first
command tells the system to create the file
<filename>$LFS/etc/group</filename> from whatever is typed on the
following lines until the sequence end of file (EOF) is encountered.
Therefore, this entire section is generally typed as seen.</para>

<para><replaceable>[REPLACED TEXT]</replaceable></para>

<para>This format is used to encapsulate text that is not to be typed
as seen<phrase condition="html"> or copy-and-pasted</phrase>.</para>
