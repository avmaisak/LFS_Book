<title>How to download the software</title>

<para>
Throughout this document I will assume that you have stored all the
packages you have downloaded somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.
</para>

<para>
I use the convention of having a $LFS/usr/src/sources directory.
Under sources you'll find the directory 0-9 and the directories a
through z. A package as sysvinit-2.78.tar.gz is stored under
$LFS/usr/src/sources/s/ A package as bash-2.04.tar.gz is stored under 
$LFS/usr/src/sources/b/ and so forth. You don't have to follow this 
convention of course, I was just giving an example. It's better to keep 
the packages out of $LFS/usr/src and move them to a subdirectory, so 
we'll have a clean $LFS/usr/src directory in which we will unpack the 
packages and work with them.
</para>

<para>
The next chapter contains the list of all the packages you need to download,
but the partition that is going to contain our LFS system isn't created yet.
Therefore store the files temporarily somewhere where you want and remember
to copy them to $LFS/usr/src/ when you have finished the chapter in which 
you prepare a new partition (chapter 4).
