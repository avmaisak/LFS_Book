<title>How to download the software</title>

<para>
Throughout this document, I will assume that all the
packages that were downloaded are placed somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.
</para>

<para>
I use the convention of having a $LFS/usr/src/sources directory.
Under sources, I have the directory 0-9 and the directories a
through z. A package as sysvinit-2.78.tar.gz is stored under
$LFS/usr/src/sources/s/. A package as bash-2.04.tar.gz is stored under 
$LFS/usr/src/sources/b/, and so forth. This convention does not have to be
followed, of course; I was just giving an example. It's better to keep 
the packages out of $LFS/usr/src and move them to a subdirectory, so 
we'll have a clean $LFS/usr/src directory in which we will unpack the 
packages and work with them.
</para>

<para>
The next chapter contains the list of all the packages that need to be
downloaded,
but the partition that is going to contain our LFS system isn't created yet.
Therefore, the files are temporarily stored somewhere else and later 
copied to $LFS/usr/src/ when the chapter in which 
the new partition is prepared has been finished.
