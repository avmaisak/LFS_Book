<title>How to download the software</title>

<para>Throughout this document, I will assume that all the
packages that were downloaded are placed somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.</para>

<para>I use the convention of having a $LFS/usr/src/sources directory.
Under sources, I have the directory 0-9 and the directories a
through z. A package like sysvinit-&sysvinit-version;.tar.bz2 is stored under
$LFS/usr/src/sources/s/. A package like bash-&bash-version;.tar.bz2 is stored 
under  $LFS/usr/src/sources/b/, and so forth. This convention does not have to 
be followed, of course; I was just giving an example. It's better to keep 
the packages out of $LFS/usr/src and move them to a subdirectory, so 
we'll have a clean $LFS/usr/src directory in which we will unpack the 
packages and work with them.</para>

<para>The next chapter contains the list of all the packages that need to be
downloaded,
but the partition that is going to contain our LFS system isn't created yet.
Therefore, the files are temporarily stored somewhere else (it's up to
you to decide where this 'else' is) and later moved to $LFS/usr/src/ when 
the chapter in which the new partition is prepared has been finished.</para>
