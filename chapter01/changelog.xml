If, for example, a change is listed for chapter 5, it (usually) means the 
same change has been made in the corresponding chapter for the other
architectures.

Converted the SGML source to XML.

Chapter 4: Tell the user to use cfdisk rather than fdisk. The fdisk man
page recommends cfdisk over fdisk because it's more stable.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 4: Changed the wording to make it more general as ext2 no
longer is the only used file system. Reiserfs, for example, is often used
too now.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 4: Updated the directory list to be more FHS compliant. Mainly
this meant adding the opt directories and removing /usr/tmp and
/usr/local/tmp
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5: Added static mawk, texinfo, and partially gettext to facilitate
the move of Glibc from Chapter 5 to Chapter 6.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5: Added Makedev to chapter 5. We don't create the device files
here, only copy the MAKEDEV script and make a temp copy which will be
used to create device files. This second file (MAKEDEV-temp) doesn't
contain user names and group names but only user id's and group id's. We
need a few device files to get Glibc installed, but, before Glibc is
installed, user and group names are not recognized yet, only the numeric
id's. This requires a slightly modified MAKEDEV script which will be
generated by patching the original one. This patching is done here in
chapter 5. Also, fixed the explanations on both makedev installations.

Chapter 5: Recommended to install all the software while logged in (or
su'ed to) user root.

Chapter 5: Simplified ln commands.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5: Removed prefix=$LFS/usr from tar's make install.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Removed fileutils-patch. After upgrading to fileutils-4.1
the patch isn't needed anymore.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Added the fileutils-4.0 patch which is needed to compile
the fileutils package on Glibc-2.2 based systems (such as the upcoming
LFS-3.0 system).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Removed --disable-nls from configuration of programs that don't
need it (bash, diffutils, gzip, sed, m4).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Changed from "cd dir &amp;&amp; make" to "make -C dir"
(gettext-static, sysvinit).
</para></listitem>

Chapter 5: Beautified the static link process for mawk.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Upgraded gcc-2.95.2 to gcc-2.95.2.1.

$LFS/usr/bin/cpp.

<listitem><para>
Chapter 5+6: Put back the instructions on how to copy/remove the old NSS library
files, in case the original distribution uses glibc-2.0.x.
</para></listitem>

Chapter 5: Added the notice about an old version of install-info.
</para></listitem>

Chapter 5: Removed the installation of a static gettext.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed libexecdir=/usr/bin in fileutils to libexecdir=/bin.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Updated Glibc installation instructions. The 'configparms' file
creation has been deleted. No need to pick a compiler (either distro's
native or the /usr/local/gcc2952/bin/gcc one); we're in chroot
now so we'll use the one we have.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Only copy the man pages from the ld.so package. We don't need
the ldconfig and ldd programs anymore; Glibc-2.2.1 comes with good
working versions.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed the procps installation from sed'ing to an easier way.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Added the creation of the lex symlink to the flex
installation.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed $* into "$@" in the yacc script during bison's
installation. "$@" allows usage of quoted arguments with blanks.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Fixed the man page installation during console-tools'
installation.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: When entering chroot, the $TERM variable inside chroot is set
properly. This is accomplished by: chroot ... -i HOME=/root TERM=$TERM ...
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Merged the different sulogin lines from the inittab file
into one line.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed all "rm file &amp;&amp; ln -s dest file" into 
"ln -sf file" (in glibc, bzip2 and gzip installations). 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Added a sed to fix a problem during glibc-installation.
pt_chown can not be installed setuid root, because "root" is not known by 
glibc yet (kind of hen and egg-problem).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed consoledata/tools to kbd, which is more actively developed,
and less of a pain to install.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Changed bin86's installation from "make PREFIX=/usr install"
to "make INSTALL_OPTS="-m 755" PREFIX=/usr install". This will prevent
install from invoking strip -s on the files. This fails because a
couple of the installed files are shell scripts rather than programs,
so they can't be stripped.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 6: Removed the ld.so section since we only used the man pages and
replaced it with a patch to man-pages.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 7: Fixed the delays in the killproc function in the functions
script. Now, after kill, first check PIDs, then sleep 2 if needed. More
details can be read in the comments in the script itself.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 7: Added the explanation how the runlevels and boot process
works when using the LFS scripts.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Chapter 7+8: Moved the creation of /etc/fstab to chapter 8.
</para></listitem>		

<listitem><para>
Chapter 10: Added this chapter. It contains "thanks and good luck"
notes and suggest creating the /etc/lfs-&version; file.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Appendix A: Added the description of the Netkit-base and Net-tools packages.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Appendix A: Added missing descriptions of frcode, code and bigram in
the findutils-4.1 package.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Everywhere: Added numerous FHS compliance notes. These instructions can be
followed if one wishes to build a fully FHS-compliant system.
