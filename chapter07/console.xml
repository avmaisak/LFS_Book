<para>If you plan to compile the keymap directly in the kernel during <xref
linkend="chapter-bootable"/> (see <xref linkend="ch-system-kbd"/>), then strictly
speaking you don't need to run this loadkeys script, since the kernel will set
up the keymap for you. If you wish, you can still run the script, it isn't going
to hurt you. Keeping it could even be beneficial, in case you run a lot of
different kernels and can't be sure that the keymap is compiled into every one
of them.</para>

<para>If you decided you don't need or don't want to use the console script,
remove the <filename class="symlink">/etc/rc.d/rcsysinit.d/S70console</filename> symlink.</para>
