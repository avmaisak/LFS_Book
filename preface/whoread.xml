<title>Who would want to read this book</title>

<para>
This book is intended for Linux users who want to setup their own
custom built Linux system. Reasons for wanting to build such a system are
diverse. Perhaps you want to get into more detail as to what
happens behind the scenes. Perhaps you are fed up with distributions
which are often bloated or perhaps you don't want to rely on pre-compiled
binaries due to security concerns. There are many reasons why a user may 
want a custom built system. If you are one of them, this book is meant
for you.

The fruits of building your own system are plentiful, but the labour may
be hard. There is a long way ahead, but in the end you will be
able to call yourself the proud owner of your own Linux system,
completely tailored after your needs. You will dictate the layout of
bootscripts, the file system hierarchy, which programs are installed in
which directory, which versions of software to use, and more. Perhaps the
most important reason is that you will know exactly what is installed where,
why, and how.
