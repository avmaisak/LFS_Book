<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it's time to reboot
the computer. Before we reboot, let's unmount $LFS/proc and the LFS
partition itself by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you decided to create multiple partitions, you need to umount the
other partitions before you umount $LFS, like this:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And you can reboot your system by running something like:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput></screen></para>

<para>At the LILO: prompt make sure that you tell it to boot 
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> and not the default entry which will boot your
host system again.</para>

<para>After you have rebooted, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>

<para>One final thing you may want to do is run lilo, now that you are
booted into LFS. This way you will put the LFS version of LILO in the MBR
rather than the one that's there right now from your host system.
Depending on how old your host distribution is, the LFS version may have
more advanced features you need/could use.</para>

<para>Either way, run the following to make the lilo version installed
on LFS active:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/sbin/lilo</userinput></screen></para>

<para>You may now remove the <filename>tools</filename> directory. If you
think you may need to redo Chapter 5, then you may wish to backup the directory
before removing it. To remove the <filename>tools</filename> directory, type
the following command, carefully:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>rm -rf /tools</userinput></screen></para>
